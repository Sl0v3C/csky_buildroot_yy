# csky_buildroot_yy
Forked from ![c-sky/buildroot](https://github.com/c-sky/buildroot) and add sth. to make csky gx6605s more fun.  
The platform for this buildroot is  ```Nationalchip GX6605S```, we want to make this tiny & cheap board becomes a litte python learning board or code reading tool with vim.  
Maybe more than those.  
The csky gx6605s introduction can visit ![C-SKY Linux Arch 介绍](https://c-sky.github.io/).

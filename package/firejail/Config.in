	  Firejail is a SUID program that reduces the risk of security
	  breaches by restricting the running environment of untrusted
	  applications using Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf. It
	  allows a process and all its descendants to have their own
	  private view of the globally shared kernel resources, such
	  as the network stack, process table, mount table.
